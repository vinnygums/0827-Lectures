props are like attributes. they get passed down from the parent to the child
a component get props from its parent or by assigning it like an attribute, the value being in curly braces
we should use state when dealing with a component that will mutate
a component must return JSX, it looks similar to HTML
we can tell if a Component is an Parent if it imports and its a Child if it Exports
